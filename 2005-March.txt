Subject: [XinePlayer-announce] XinePlayer version 0.2 released!
Message-ID: <fa8acc90503211855677428db@mail.gmail.com>

Lots of new features. Download from http://xineplayer.berlios.de/ as always.

ChangeLog:

	* 'Open URL...' menu option.
	* Support for playlist-like files (e.g. RealAudio streams from websites).
	* Any errors opening a stream are reported.
	* Reports progress of network operations.
	* Uses less memory and CPU (hopefully) on lower-spec machines.
	* Ogg vorbis support.
	* If XinePlayer cannot open a movie it will tell you.
	* Can automatically resize window on movie size change.
	* Display a little notification in the video window when state
changes (e.g. deinterlace is toggled, etc).
	* Attempt to open any type of file passed (i.e. no longer
	grey-out files in Open dialogue).
	* Deinterlacing is now done via xine's tvtime deinterlace plugin.
	* Implement preferences dialogue.
	* Audio visualisation support.
	* Support post-processing plugins.
	* Only use one xine engine instance per app.
	* Fix frame corruption bug whereby colours appeared 'streaky' with
certain movies.
